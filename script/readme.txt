This folder will contain the code that I will write to analyze the data and create the unpublished figure given to me by Dr. Summers

Thsi code will need to data wrangle a csv file and take the averages of eigth visual fields for hours 1-13 for each well. After having found all the means, the second half of the code will be to create a graph with the means plotted on a scatterplot with the degeneration index on the y axis and the time on the x axis.
